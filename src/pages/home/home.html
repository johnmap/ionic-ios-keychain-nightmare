  <h2>Welcome to Ionic!</h2>
  <p>
    This is a demo of the unwanted behaviour that causes the keychain bar (for login autofill from saved passwords)
    to appear when non-login/password fields are focused, if a login/password field has been focused in the current
    app lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>
    First tap the password field below to focus it. The keychain bar will appear – seemingly there's pretty much no way
    now to prevent this behaviour, but ok, fine.
  </p>
  <p>Next go to the "Step 2" tab.</p>
  <form>
    <input type="password" name="password" />
  </form>
